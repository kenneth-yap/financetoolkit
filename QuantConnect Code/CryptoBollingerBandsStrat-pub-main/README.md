## Summary

[Bollinger bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollinger_Bands) are indicators that show the price and volatility of an instrument. There are three bands: the middle line is a moving average, the upper and lower bands are plus/minus k standard deviations.

A simple strategy based on Bollinger Bands is to buy/sell if the asset price is above/below the upper/middle band.
