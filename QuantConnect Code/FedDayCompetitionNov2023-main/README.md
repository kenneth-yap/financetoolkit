# CUATS Fed Day Social Algorithmic Trading Competition

Starting with a cash balance of $100,000, develop a trading algorithm that achieves the maximum profit with a maximum drawdown of 10%, and is benchmarked against the S&P 500 Index.  We will run all trading strategies live from 14:30 to 21:00 on the Fed Day (Wednesday, 1 November 2023).  You may use any tradable instrument across all assets of the US markets available on QuantConnect in constructing your trading strategy.  

Note: A template code will be provided including the default QuantConnect standard execution model and fees structure as well as maximum leverage limit of 10 -  similar to what has been used in our example strategies from the CUATS Coding Sessions. 

Do make use of the algorithmic trading strategies (EMA, Pairs Trading, Statistical Arbitrage in ETFs) and indicators (Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD) we have covered in the Coding Sessions to construct your algorithm, taking note of the high volatility typically experienced on Fed Days - particularly around the announcement and press conference periods - and exploring ways to exploit this market behaviour and associated price anomalies in certain securities to create a profitable intraday trading strategy.
