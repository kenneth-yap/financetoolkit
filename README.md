# My Finance Toolkit
Notes and Jupyter notebooks that I use to manage my own finances.

- Savings Notebook: For those to forecast the compounding effect of placing money in a savings account. You can customise the number of accounts, the annual interest rate of each, starting capital, monthly contribution and duration of compounding.

- Stocks Notebook: This notebook is a result of my coursework in the MSc in Financial Engineering course. It extracts data from Yahoo Finance to perform exploratory data analysis.

I will consistently update these notebooks as I aim to expand my portfolio and progress through my MSc. Feel free to use it for your own use!
