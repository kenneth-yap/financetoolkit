# My Finance Toolkit
Notes and Jupyter notebooks that I use to manage my own finances.

- Savings Notebook: To forecast the compounding effect of placing money in a savings account. You can customise the number of accounts,annual interest rate, starting capital, monthly contribution and duration of compounding.

- Stocks Notebook: This notebook is a result of a coursework in the MSc in Financial Engineering course. It extracts data from Yahoo Finance for exploratory data analysis.

I will consistently update these notebooks as I expand my portfolio and progress through my MSc. Feel free to download it for your own use!
