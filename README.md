# My Finance Toolkit
Here are resources that I use to manage my own finances.

- <a href="https://github.com/kenneth-yap/financetoolkit/tree/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks">Jupyter Notebooks</a>: To forecast the compounding effect of my money in multiple savings account and in stocks. Feel free to customise the number of accounts,annual interest rate, starting capital, monthly contribution and duration of compounding.

- <a href="https://github.com/kenneth-yap/financetoolkit/tree/main/Books">Books</a>: A library of resources that I will slowly (but surely) understand.

- <a href="https://github.com/kenneth-yap/financetoolkit/tree/main/QuantConnect%20Code">QuantConnect Code</a>: Python algorithms that I test and implement on the QuantConnect Platform. Many of which are still work in progress.

I will consistently update these notebooks as I expand my portfolio and progress through my MSc in Financial Engineering. Feel free to download it for your own use!
